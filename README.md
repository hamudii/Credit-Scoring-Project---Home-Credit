# Credit-Scoring-Project---Home-Credit
Home Credit’s initiative employs statistical and machine learning methods to predict credit scores, aiming to maximize the potential of their data. The project’s goal is to create models that ensure creditworthy customers are not denied loans and to offer loan terms that encourage successful repayment.
